After you've built your business page, invite friends and existing customers to "Like" your business. Everyone who clicks your page's "Like" button receives automatic updates each time you post to your company page. Your page is a great place to share news about your business, including upcoming events, special sales or new product releases. All the page's status updates appear on the news feeds of everyone who liked your business, serving as free advertising to your core customer base. Customers may also share your posts, add comments or contact the page administrator directly through Facebook, enhancing interactivity.
